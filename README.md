✨ Welcome ✨

You'll see me online using the handle sys0. I'm a pentester working in Manhattan with a passionate interest in computer viruses. I've recently been working on creating and using badUSB scripts. 
I love the internet, and I want to help make it the best it can be. 

I enjoy gardening and creating pixel art. Are you a fan of my avatar art? You can find a link to some other pieces of mine below!
